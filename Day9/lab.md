## 7. Recommendations

It is recommended that the following actions be taken to mitigate the identified risks, prioritized by severity:

1.  **Critical/High:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** [e.g., Unpatched Apache Struts (CVE-XXXX-YYYY) on 1.2.3.4]
        *   **Recommendation:** [e.g., Apply vendor patch immediately. Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules as a compensating control.]
    *   **Vulnerability:** [e.g., Default SNMP Community Strings on 1.2.3.5]
        *   **Recommendation:** [e.g., Change SNMP community strings to strong, unique values or disable SNMP if not required.]
    *   **Vulnerability:** [e.g., Weak password for 'admin' user on example-lab.com/login]
        *   **Recommendation:** [e.g., Enforce strong password policy. Implement account lockout mechanisms. Consider Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).]
2.  **Medium:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** [e.g., SSL Medium Strength Ciphers enabled on 1.2.3.4]
        *   **Recommendation:** [e.g., Reconfigure web server to disable weak ciphers and protocols (SSLv3, TLS 1.0/1.1), enabling only strong options (TLS 1.2/1.3).]
3.  **Low:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** [e.g., Verbose error messages on example-lab.com]
        *   **Recommendation:** [e.g., Configure application to display generic error messages to users.]
