**1. Introduction:**

This lab report details the process of creating a Docker container hosting multiple network services (SSH, HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and DNS) to establish a controlled environment for practicing network scanning techniques using tools like Nmap. The objective was to create a functional, albeit basic, network with diverse services running, each containing a simulated "flag" that could be discovered through scanning and interaction.

**2. Objectives:**

* To create a Docker container based on Ubuntu Linux.
* To install and configure SSH, Nginx (HTTP), vsftpd (FTP), Postfix (SMTP), and BIND9 (DNS) within the container.
* To embed simulated "flags" within each service that can be identified through network scanning and service interaction.
* To document the steps taken and the methods used to attach the flags.

**3. Methodology:**

The following steps were undertaken to create the multi-service Docker container:

1.  **Dockerfile Creation:** A Dockerfile was created to define the environment and the steps required to build the Docker image. This included:
    * Selecting the base Ubuntu image.
    * Updating package lists and installing the necessary service packages.
    * Configuring each service with minimal settings for basic functionality.
    * Embedding simulated flags within the configuration or content of each service.
    * Exposing the standard ports for each service.
    * Defining the command to start all services when the container runs.

2.  **Image Building:** The Docker image was built using the `docker build` command from the directory containing the Dockerfile.

3.  **Container Running:** A Docker container was run from the created image, mapping the container's ports to the host machine's ports to allow interaction with the services.

4.  **Flag Attachment:** Simulated flags ("POKHARA\_\[SERVICE]\_FLAG") were integrated into each service using the following methods:
    * **HTTP (Nginx):** The flag was placed directly within the default `index.html` file served by Nginx.
    * **FTP (vsftpd):** The flag was stored in a file (`flag.txt`) within a dedicated FTP user's home directory. The welcome message hinted at its location.
    * **SMTP (Postfix):** The flag was added to the SMTP banner, visible upon connection to port 25.
    * **DNS (BIND9):** The flag was set as the value of a TXT record for a specific hostname (`flag.example.com`).
    * **SSH (OpenSSH):** While a direct flag wasn't placed in a banner or file in this basic setup, the concept of a flag being accessible after successful login with provided credentials was implied. 

5.  **Flag Capture Simulation:** The process of capturing the flags involved simulating a typical network scanning workflow:
    *   **Host Discovery:** Identifying the container's IP address (e.g., using `nmap -sn <network_range>`). Let's assume the container IP is `172.17.0.2` for these examples.
    *   **Port Scanning:** Scanning the target IP to find open ports using Nmap: `nmap 172.17.0.2`.
    *   **Service/Version Detection:** Identifying the services and their versions running on the open ports for more targeted interaction: `nmap -sV 172.17.0.2 -p 21,22,25,53,80`.
    *   **Service Interaction & Flag Retrieval:** Accessing each identified service to retrieve the flag:
        *   **HTTP (Port 80):** Using a web browser or `curl http://172.17.0.2/` to view the index page content.
        *   **FTP (Port 21):** Connecting with an FTP client (`ftp 172.17.0.2`), logging in (e.g., user `ftpuser`, password `password`), listing files (`ls`), and retrieving the flag file (`get flag.txt`).
        *   **SMTP (Port 25):** Connecting using `telnet 172.17.0.2 25` or `nc 172.17.0.2 25` to view the service banner.
        *   **DNS (Port 53):** Querying the specific TXT record using `dig @172.17.0.2 flag.example.com TXT` or `nslookup -type=TXT flag.example.com 172.17.0.2`.
        *   **SSH (Port 22):** Attempting to connect using `ssh root@172.17.0.2` and providing the known password (`rootpassword`) to gain access (where a flag might hypothetically be placed post-login).

    | `ftp 172.17.0.2` (then `login`, `ls`, `get flag.txt`)                         | **FTP Interaction (Port 21):** Connecting, logging in, listing files, and downloading the flag file.    |
    | `telnet 172.17.0.2 25` or `nc 172.17.0.2 25`                                   | **SMTP Interaction (Port 25):** Connecting to view the service banner.                                  |

**4. Results:**

1.  **Docker Build:** A Docker image named `multi-service-lab` was successfully built. A container was run based on this image, exposing the following ports on the host machine:

    * **22:** SSH
    * **80:** HTTP (Nginx)
    * **21:** FTP (vsftpd)
    * **25:** SMTP (Postfix)
    * **53 (TCP/UDP):** DNS (BIND9)

2. **Flag integration:** The simulated flags were successfully integrated into each service as described in the methodology. These flags could be potentially discovered through network scanning (identifying open ports and services) and subsequent interaction with those services using appropriate client tools (e.g., web browser for HTTP, `ftp` command for FTP, `telnet` for SMTP, `dig` or `nslookup` for DNS, `ssh` command for SSH).

**5. Discussion:**

This lab demonstrates a simple method for creating a multi-service environment suitable for practicing basic network scanning. The use of Docker allows for easy setup and isolation of the environment. The integration of simulated flags provides a tangible goal for scanning exercises â€“ to identify the services and retrieve the hidden information.

The flag attachment methods were straightforward for this initial setup. For more advanced CTF-style challenges, flags could be hidden more intricately, potentially requiring deeper interaction with the services or the exploitation of intentional vulnerabilities.

The SSH service in this basic configuration relies on a hardcoded password for the root user, which is highly insecure for any real-world scenario. In a more complex lab, key-based authentication or user enumeration challenges could be incorporated.

The DNS configuration is minimal, serving as a basic example. More complex DNS challenges could involve zone transfers, reverse lookups, or identifying specific record types.

**6. Conclusion:**

A multi-service Docker container was successfully created, providing a basic yet functional environment for network scanning practice. Simulated flags were embedded within each service, demonstrating a simple way to integrate targets for discovery. This setup can be further expanded and customized to create more complex and realistic network scanning scenarios for learning and experimentation in Pokhara or anywhere else.

**7. Further Enhancements for CTF-Style Flags:**

* **More Realistic Flag Placement:** Instead of just `flag.txt`, hide flags in less obvious locations within the file systems or service configurations.
* **Service-Specific Challenges:** Design challenges that require interacting with the services in specific ways to retrieve the flag (e.g., sending a particular email, making a specific HTTP request, uploading a file via FTP).
* **User Enumeration:** For SSH and FTP, the challenge could involve finding valid usernames and passwords first.
* **Vulnerabilities:** You could intentionally introduce vulnerabilities in the service configurations or applications running within them, where the flag is revealed upon successful exploitation.
* **Custum Service:** Add more services or customize existing ones.Create specific tasks or challenges that require a combination of scanning and service interaction to retrieve flags
* **container orchestration:** Explore using container orchestration tools like Docker Compose to manage multiple interconnected containers for more complex network scenarios.
